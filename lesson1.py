# Type 1 - Strings
# can use ' or " to indicate string - be consistent

# f-strings are formatted strings that help with combining string

# Way 1 to combine string: use + (concatenation)
# Caution: all numbers have to have str( ) around them
message_one = "Welcome " + user_name + " with ID " + str(user_id)
print(message_one)

# Way 2 - use f strings
# put variables in curly braces
message_two = f"Welcome {user_name} with ID {user_id}"
print(message_two)

# Possible errors
# apostrophes inside of single quotes
# resolution: use escape sequence \ - tells python next symbol is
# literally that thing, no Pythonic meaning
